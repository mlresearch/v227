title: Reproducibility of Training Deep Learning Models for Medical Image Analysis
abstract: 'Performance of deep learning algorithms varies due to their development
  data and training method, but also due to several stochastic processes during training.
  Due to these random factors, a single training run may not accurately reflect the
  performance of a given training method. Statistical comparisons in literature between
  different deep learning training methods typically ignore this performance variation
  between training runs and incorrectly claim significance of changes in training
  method. We hypothesize that the impact of such performance variation is substantial,
  such that it may invalidate biomedical competition leaderboards and some scientific
  papers. To test this, we investigate the reproducibility of training deep learning
  algorithms for medical image analysis. We repeated training runs from prior scientific
  studies: three diagnostic tasks (pancreatic cancer detection in CT, clinically significant
  prostate cancer detection in MRI, and lung nodule malignancy risk estimation in
  low-dose CT) and two organ segmentation tasks (pancreas segmentation in CT and prostate
  segmentation in MRI). A previously published top-performing algorithm for each task
  was trained multiple times to determine the variance in model performance. For all
  three diagnostic algorithms, performance variation from retraining was significant
  compared to data variance. Statistically comparing independently trained algorithms
  from the same training method using the same dataset should follow the null hypothesis,
  but we observed claimed significance with a p-value below 0.05 in 15% of comparisons
  with conventional testing (paired bootstrapping). We conclude that variance in model
  performance due to retraining is substantial and should be accounted for.'
